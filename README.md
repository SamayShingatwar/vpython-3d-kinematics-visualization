# VPython 3D Kinematics Visualization

This project uses **VPython to visualize 3D motion inside a transparent cube**, serving as a learning exercise for real-time 3D graphics and kinematic visualization.

The simulation was developed to build familiarity with VPython in preparation for **visualizing real-time roll, pitch, and yaw data from an Arduino-based IMU system**. It establishes the groundwork for future orientation and attitude visualization driven by live sensor data.
